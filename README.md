## How to Play ?

You are the red circle in the center of the screen. Use your mouse to point in the direction you want to move.

Your objective is to gain mass and grow larger by consuming food particles (small pentagons) and other players. Other players are moving circles of various sizes. You can only consume other players that are smaller than you, and larger players will consume you. Be careful and survive as long as possible!

If you have any suggestions for features or you have found a bug, please file an issue here. If you would like to host your own server, consult the README and setup guide.

Have fun!


#### Game Basics
- Move your mouse on the screen to move your character

- A player's **mass** is the number of food particles eaten
- **Objective**: Try to get fat and eat other players

#### Gameplay Rules
- Players who haven't eaten yet cannot be eaten
- Everytime a player joins the game, **3** food particles will spawn
- Everytime a food particle is eaten by a player, **1** new food particle will respawn
- The more food you eat, the slower you move
